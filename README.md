# Udacity Games Played
React app that lets us add a user's first name, last name, and username. When the user is added, the number of games that he/she has played is defaulted to 0. Each username has to be unique, so we cannot add multiple users with the same username. When someone clicks "Add" but the username already exists, the app does not allow for a duplicate user to be added and shows an error message instead.

The app also displays a list of users, specifically their usernames and the number of games they've played (which is defaulted to 0). If someone tries to add a user when one of the fields is empty, the "Add" button should be disabled.

There's a button that lets us toggle between showing and hiding the number of games the users have played. Clicking that button should change the button text to "Show the Number of Games Played" and the displayed username and score can be changed to "username1 played * games."

## Start Project
After adding the dependencies (by running "npm install"), the app can be launched by running "npm start".
